# FaceMem
Repository for CONTROLLING THE MEMORABILITY OF REAL AND UNREAL FACE IMAGES

The assessors folder is consist of face memorability assessors and object memorability assessors. We trained the face memorability assessors by ourselves and used memnet for object memorability assessor. We trained our models multiple times with different hyperparameters and options. We have provided all the python files for training the face memorability models.
stylegan2_memo.ipynb is an interactive notebook for the project.
faces folder is consist of faces with different weights of memorability modification.
There are samples horses as an example of experiment of with stylegan2 and non-facial weights
